        <p>
            Phytochemical Explorer is a curated database aimed at supporting natural products researchers,
            biochemists, and pharmaceutical scientists by providing structured information on phytochemicals,
            their sources, and geographical origins. This project was developed with the goal of enabling easy access to
            large-scale compound data extracted from scientific literature.
